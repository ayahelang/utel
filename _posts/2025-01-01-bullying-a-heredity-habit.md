        <h1>Bullying - A Heredity Habit</h1>

                Bullying in Indonesia is no longer just juvenile delinquency. It has become a systemic social
                phenomenon—claiming lives in schools, Islamic boarding schools, and even government institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                From junior high school students traumatized by bullying by classmates, to Islamic boarding school
                students beaten to death by seniors, to civil service academy cadets who lost their lives due to the
                “tradition of seniority.” All of this occurs in spaces that are supposed to educate and protect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ironically, these educational institutions—both modern and traditional—often cover up cases in order to
                protect the institution's reputation. Victims' reports are suppressed, families are blamed, and the
                public is presented with the classic excuse: “It was just internal training.” As a result, bullying
                becomes a hereditary habit that continues to be passed down.
